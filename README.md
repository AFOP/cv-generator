## About Project

This project aims to automatically generate resumes in a simple format. Through specific questions, users are facilitated in creating their first Curriculum Vitae. The application is developed in Laravel, which ensures an efficient and user-friendly experience.

## Used technology:

- [Laravel](https://www.laravel.com).
- [MySQl](https://www.mysql.com/).
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
- [Php](https://www.php.net/).

## Learning Objectives

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):
Laravel follows the MVC design pattern, which divides the application into three main components: the Model (in charge of managing the data and logic of the application), the View (in charge of displaying information to the user) and the Controller (manages the user interactions and application logic).**

- **Composer:
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that Laravel uses to manage its own dependencies and so you can easily add third-party packages to your project.**

- **Artisan:
Artisan is Laravel's command line interface (CLI). It allows you to perform common tasks such as database migration, generating drivers and models, and more.**

- **Eloquent ORM:
Laravel uses Eloquent, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), to interact with databases. Eloquent allows you to perform database operations using a friendly, object-oriented syntax instead of SQL.**

- **Routes and Drivers:
Understanding how to define routes and use handlers to handle HTTP requests is essential. Laravel makes it easy to create routes and controllers to manage your application logic.**

## Challenges:

- Migrations and Database:
Understanding how migrations work and working with the database was a challenge at first. Understand Eloquent relationships and how to design and migrate the database effectively.

- PHP versions:
The challenge was that when working on several Laravel projects I must take into account the PHP versions that I am using for my project.
